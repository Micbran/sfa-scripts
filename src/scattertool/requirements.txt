GUI:
    * Allow user to select a polygon object (source object)
    * Allow user to select a polygon object and/or vertices to scatter to (destination)
    * Allow user to specify minimum and maximum random scale in x, y and z axes (1.0 - inf)
        * Allow user to specify "square" scale, which scales each axis by the same random amount
        * Allow user to specify min and max random scale for square scale
    * Allow user to specify minimum and maximum rotation angle along x, y and z axes (0 - 360)

Scatter:
    * Create instances (not copies) of the source object
    * Move instances to vertices on destination object AND to all selected vertices
    * Scale objects randomly based on range in each axis.
    * Rotate objects randomly based on range in each axis.
